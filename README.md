# Nasdaq-100-Analysis
The NASDAQ100 Index is a collection of 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange. The purpose of this project is to analyze the risk-adjusted returns of the index as well as its constituents, using a variety of quantitative and fundamental analysis techniques.

The project begins by calculating the Sharpe ratio for each constituent over the past 2 and 5-year periods, and comparing it to the index's Sharpe ratio. Next, fundamental data is obtained from finviz.com and used to explain the difference in past returns by summarizing fundamental and descriptive data.

The project then focuses on the best-performing stocks in the index, comparing them to the overall index to gain insights into what factors may have contributed to their outperformance.

Through this analysis, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the NASDAQ100 Index and its constituents, and to provide insights that can help inform investment decisions.
